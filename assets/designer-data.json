      "Project Summary": "Utilizing Mycelium for Interior Applications ",
      "Project Description": "MyTile is a bio-based alternative to traditional soundproofing materials and interior wall tiles, grown from mycelium and agricultural waste. Lightweight and relatively inexpensive, the most significant advantage of this mycelium-based material is its rapid biodegradability. When compared to traditional materials, such as foams and petroleum-based soundproofing panels, mycelium-based materials can be produced at a lower cost while also minimizing environmental impact. Mycelium is just one organism that exemplifies the advantages of bringing nature into everyday life, inspiring circular design methods.",
